				We the People of Myanmar condemn the unlawful exercise of power obtained by the mean of weapon. Under the circumstance of the illegitimate government it must be assumed that the citizens shall directly exercise the State’s power. The public mechanism shall be, in that circumstance, run by the cooperation among the citizens, and Demons who defy liberty and justice will be fought back and annihilated by any available means.

		<h3>We the People of Myanmar declare as follows:-</h3>

		<p>With the primacy of liberty and justice, we consistently recognise the government elected through free and fair elections;</p>

		<p>We do not accept but consistently condemn any actions which are against the just law and are violent with the use of force;</p>

		<p>We shall rightly wield the State’s power as the sovereign people under the circumstance  the legitimate government, elected through free and fair elections held at regular intervals, can not exercise the power vested in them. No institution nor individual must have the right to declare itself and get recognized as the government in and out of the country.</p>

		<p>With the emphasis on the State’s resilience, we shall ever let the public mechanism run through the means of supporting and protecting each other among the citizens.</p>

		<p>The legitimate government which can exercise the power by mean of the regular elections does not dwell in a place, a building and a symbol, but in the heart of the people.</p>

		<p>This message shall be heard by those in power, holding weapons and in charge of the public mechanism at any time and at any circumstance.</p>

		<p>O Demons who defy liberty and justice!</p>

		<p>We the People of Myanmar shall outlaw thy inglorious practices in our land by any means that include, but not limited to, echoing with the sound of pots and pans, slamming and shunning, mocking and scorning, and peaceful protests.</p>
